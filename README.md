A powerful *Email OSINT tool* that checks if a specific email is registered on various sites, combined with *username scanning* for branding or OSINT — 2-in-1 tool.  

Perfect for fast, accurate and lightweight email OSINT

Perfect for finding a **unique username** across GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and more, all in a single command.  

## Features

- ✅ Email & username OSINT: check email registrations and username availability across social, developer, creator, and other platforms  
- ✅ Dual-mode usage: works as an email scanner, username scanner, or username-only tool  
- ✅ Clear results: `Registered` / `Not Registered` for emails and `Available` / `Taken` / `Error` for usernames with precise failure reasons  
- ✅ Fully modular architecture for easy addition of new platform modules  
- ✅ Bulk scanning support for usernames and emails via input files  
- ✅ Wildcard-based username permutations with automatic variation generation  
- ✅ Multiple output formats: console, **JSON**, and **CSV**, with file export support  
- ✅ Proxy support with rotation and pre-scan proxy validation  
- ✅ Smart auto-update system with interactive upgrade prompts via PyPI

## Usage

### Basic username/email scan

Scan a single email or username across **all** available modules/platforms:

```bash
user-scanner -e john_doe@gmail.com   # single email scanning 
user-scanner -u john_doe             # single username scanning 
```

### Selective scanning

Scan only specific categories or single modules:

```bash
user-scanner -u john_doe -c dev # developer platforms only
user-scanner -u john_doe -m github # only GitHub
```

### Bulk email/username scanning

Scan multiple emails/usernames from a file (one email/username per line):
- Can also be combined with categories or modules using `-c` , `-m` and other flags

```bash
user-scanner -ef emails.txt     # bulk email scan
user-scanner -uf usernames.txt  # bulk username scan
```

### Username/Email variations (suffix only)

Generate & check username variations using a permutation from the given suffix:

```bash
user-scanner -u john_ -p ab # john_a, ..., john_ab, john_ba
```

### Using Proxies

Route requests through proxy servers:

```bash
user-scanner -u john_doe -P proxies.txt
```

Validate proxies before scanning (tests each proxy against google.com):

```bash
user-scanner -u john_doe -P proxies.txt --validate-proxies # recommended
```

This will:
1. Filter out non-working proxies
2. Save working proxies to `validated_proxies.txt`
3. Use only validated proxies for scanning

**Module guidelines:**
This project contains small "validator" modules that check whether a username exists on a given platform. Each validator is a single function that returns a Result object (see `core/orchestrator.py`).

Result semantics:
- Result.available() → `available`
- Result.taken() → `taken`
- Result.error(message: Optional[str]) → `error`, blocked, unknown, or request failure (include short diagnostic message when helpful)

Follow this document when adding or updating validators.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for examples.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Some sites may return **403 Forbidden** or **connection timeout** errors, especially if they are blocked in your region (this is common with some adult sites).

- If a site is blocked in your region, use a VPN and select a region where you know the site is accessible.
- Then run the tool again.

These issues are caused by regional or network restrictions, not by the tool itself. If it still fails, report the error by opening an issue.
